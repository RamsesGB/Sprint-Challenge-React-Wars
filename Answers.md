1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React is a powerful UI component library whoâ€™s purpose is to build applications. It uses the virtual DOM to update any changes that will be made over time. This helps a lot with processing and takes a lot of work load off the DOM.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

To think in React means to visualize applications as being built by components and how to form a data flow between them utilizing state and props

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

The main difference as I understand it is that stateful components have the ability to act as the central point of information storage in the form of memory in the components 'state'. Functional components dont have state and are known as 'dumb' components. functional components can return JSX but in order for Class components to output JSX it must be done within the   render() function.

1.  Describe state.

State can be thought of as the heart of React. It holds Data and determines how components render code.

1.  Describe props.

If State is the heart then props are the blood of React. It allows data flow from parent to child components.
